# Java_Virtual_Cafe
This project I built a “Virtual Café” system, using a client-server architecture.  Each client application will play the role of a Customer who wants to order tea or coffee. The server application will play the role of the café's virtual Barista, who processes the orders, prepares tea and coffee, and delivers orders back to the customers.
